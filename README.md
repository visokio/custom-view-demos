# custom-view-demos

Public sources for the Custom View demos we threw together to demonstrate using the Custom View APIs to create your own views for Omniscope.

Feel free to copy, derive, use and publish any of these views, but note that some files are 3rd party and are indicated so in the file itself's header; refer to their own licenses for distribution/use restrictions. 

Pull requests with new or updated demos are welcome.
